## Cursor-Specific Capabilities
- **File Referencing:** Use `@` mentions when reading or modifying files to ensure maximum context accuracy.
- **Code Generation:** Do not explain obvious things. Output only the necessary code changes.
- **Indexing:** Rely on Cursor's fast codebase indexing. Do not blindly `grep` or `find` if you can use semantic search.
