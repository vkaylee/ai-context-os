# Skills Directory

This directory contains modular AI capabilities used as part of the **Fallback Architecture**. 

### Standard Skills:
- **gold-standards.md**: Core engineering quality benchmarks.
- **diamond-standards.md**: High-tier autonomous perfection rules.
- **refactoring-blueprint.md**: Strategies for maintaining 200-line modularity.
- **test-driven-development.md**: Protocols for Test-First engineering.
- **documentation-engine.md**: Rules for self-syncing documentation.

If you want to add your own project-specific skills, create a `.local-os/skills/` directory in your project root; the AI will prioritize those.
