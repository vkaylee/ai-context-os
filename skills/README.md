# Skills Directory

This directory contains modular AI capabilities (e.g., React, Python, etc.). 
Files here are used as part of the **Fallback Architecture**. 

If you want to add your own project-specific skills, you can create a `.local-os/skills/` directory in your project root, and the AI will prioritize those over the ones found here.
