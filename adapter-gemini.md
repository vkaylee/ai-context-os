# ✨ Adapter: GEMINI.md (L1)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are operating under the AI Context OS.
> **Law:** Read and adhere to the entire AI Operating System at: `.ai-context-os/PROJECT_OS.md` and skills at `.ai-context-os/skills/`.
> **Fast-Track:** Run `npx ai-context-os scout --ultra` to instantly sync with the project's active state.
> **Fallback:** If the project has `.local-os/`, prioritize `.local-os/` first.

## Gemini-Specific Capabilities
- **Context Window:** Leverage your massive context window to cross-reference multiple skills before execution.
- **Strict Adherence:** Follow operational protocols extremely tightly. Treat `PROJECT_OS.md` as immutable law.
- **Tool Selection:** Always prioritize native API tools over raw bash commands. Use `task_boundary` mechanic stringently.

Default AI adapter reference: `.ai-context-os/GEMINI.md`
