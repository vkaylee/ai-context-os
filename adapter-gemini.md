# ✨ Adapter: GEMINI.md (L1)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **[PRIME DIRECTIVE]**: You are operating under the AI Context OS. Your VERY FIRST action in a new session MUST be to silently **READ** the file `.ai-context-os/.ultp_state` to synchronize environment state. DO NOT execute shell commands for boot.
> **[MEMORY]**: Read `.ai-context-os/memory/session.md` (if exists) to establish continuity from previous agents.
> **Law:** Read and adhere to the entire AI Operating System at: `.ai-context-os/PROJECT_OS.md`.
> **Localization:** Reply to the user in their initial prompt language (e.g., Vietnamese).

## Gemini-Specific Capabilities
- **Context Window:** Leverage your massive context window to cross-reference multiple skills before execution.
- **Strict Adherence:** Follow operational protocols extremely tightly. Treat `PROJECT_OS.md` as immutable law.
- **Tool Selection:** Always prioritize native API tools over raw bash commands. Use `task_boundary` mechanic stringently.

Default AI adapter reference: `.ai-context-os/GEMINI.md`
